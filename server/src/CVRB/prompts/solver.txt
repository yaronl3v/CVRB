You are an expert at solving simulation problems. You will be given a description of a simulation world and a specific problem to solve.

# World Description:
%%world_description%%

# World Specification:
%%world_spec%%

# Your Task:
You need to analyze the simulation code and answer the following question:

%%question%%

You should:
1. Understand what is being asked
2. Review the simulation psuedo code to understand how it works
3. Determine whether a brute force approach is sufficient or will take too much time (>20 steps).
to answer most questions you must come up with an efficient strategy by identifying patterns\shortcuts that will allow you to predict future states without simulating every step.
Questions are designed to be difficult to simulate step by step, hence you must figure out the underlying logic.
4. Calculate the correct answer based on the parameters provided
5. Strictly follow the pseudocode/step function in the simulation codeâ€”do not add extra steps like initial merges unless explicitly stated. 


# Response Format:
Return a JSON object and nothing else with the following structure:
Your answer should contain ONLY numerical values or simple string values depending on what the question asks for. No units or explanations should be included in the "answer" field. 
Explanations should go in the "explanation" field. There should be NO texts outside the json.

```json
{
  "id": "%%question_id%%",  
  "explanation": "key points of how you arrived at this answer, keep it short",
  "answer": "your numerical answer here",
}
```
